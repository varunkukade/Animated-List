# Draggable Animated List Component

This repository demonstrates a code to create a reusable code for the Draggable Animated List Component from stratch.

	â€¢ Built on bare react native project.
	â€¢ Utilized react-native-gesture-handler and react-native-reanimated v3.
	â€¢ Once you understand the core logic, you can customize it as per your requirements.
	â€¢ You can utilize the logic as the future library and React native versions will definitely change.
